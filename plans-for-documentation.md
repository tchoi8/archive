Set up plans for documentation/archiving prior to event. 
In other words, documentation planning should be part of the coordination process from the beginning, or as soon as the event starts taking shape.

- what to document (photos, audio/video recordings, livestream, slides, transcripts, notes)
- what to publish ( â€œ )
- where each public documentation will live

Get consent from relevant parties prior to, or on the day of, event - depending on type of documentation

- speakers, artists, panel, etc
- attendees (photo/video release, q&a identification, etc)
