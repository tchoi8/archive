# Documentation guidelines
 
Best practice 

- Set up plans for documentation/archiving prior to event. 
- Delegate documnetation/archiving/communication task to staff member prior to event. 

### Documentation planning should be part of the coordination process from the beginning, or as soon as the event starts taking shape.

- What to document (photos, audio/video recordings, livestream, slides, transcripts, notes)
- What to publish ( “ )
- Where each public documentation will live
- Timeline for documenting, archiving and publishing 
- Budget for documentation (refer to studio budget template)


### Get consent from relevant parties prior to, or on the day of, event, depending on type of documentation 
- speakers, artists, panel, etc
- attendees (photo/video release, q&a identification, etc)

### Set up an iterable framework/template

- a distributed storage directory or git repository that has a well organized directory structure.  
- this will ideally include everything related to the planning and archiving of a specific event.
- there will be physical and cloud-based backups. 
- private/sensitive material should remain in private storage only.
- camera-ready PR material (selected/edited “A cuts” of photos, videos) should be contained in a separate directory, for convenience of future use.
- a template of spreadsheet or task board w/ action plans during event planning, days leading up to the event, d-day, post-event, etc
